# Smart Workout
## Smart Workout is a web platform designed to help users create personalized workout routines or receive customized plans from a personal trainer. 
## I built the application during the Summer Camp organised by Netrom Software and I used Symfony for the backend and implemented a user-friendly frontend with HTML and BootStrap CSS.
